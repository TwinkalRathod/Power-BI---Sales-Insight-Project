# Power-BI-Sales-Insight-Project
I got this SQL data from Code basic online tutorials and made my first PowerBI Dashboard.
This dynamic visualization dashboard is about sales insights.
I used SQL to change data structure. Data cleaning done in PowerBI. Added custom column & new measures.
Found Top 5 products & Top 5 cutomers by revenue.Used clustered bar chart for visualization.
Displayed revenue by year using Line chart.
Used Slicers for Year filter.
